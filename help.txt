Hello!
This program can find movies by some parameters set by user.
For example:
Name - name of the movie;
Release date - full date when the movie was released;
Genre - genre of the movie... etc
All you need to do is to choose parameters and to choose which method of searching movies you would like to use. There are 3 of them: DOM, SAX and LINQ.
Also, you are able to transform your movies into HTML-table, just click "Transform to HTML".
Good luck!
